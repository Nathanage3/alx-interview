#üß† Algorithm & Data Structure Challenges

This section highlights my proficiency in core computer science fundamentals, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving.

**Project Directory** &emsp;&emsp;**Concept / Skill Demonstrated**

0x00-pascal_triangle&emsp;&emsp;Algorithmic Thinking & 2D Arrays

<br />

Implements an algorithm to generate Pascal's Triangle, demonstrating efficient list manipulation and nested loops.


<br />


0x01-lockboxes&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Graph Traversal / Logic
<br />


Solves a logic puzzle that models a directed graph, determining if all "boxes" (nodes) can be visited starting from the first box.

<br />



0x02-minimum_operations&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dynamic Programming


<br />
Finds the fewest number of operations to achieve a target number using "Copy All" and "Paste" operations, a classic dynamic programming problem.

<br />



0x04-utf8_validation&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bit Manipulation


<br />
Develops a method to validate if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding, requiring direct manipulation of data at the bit level.

<br />



0x05-nqueens&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Backtracking Algorithm
<br />


Solves the N-Queens puzzle by placing N chess queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. This is a classic backtracking problem.

<br />



0x0G-rotate_2d_matrix&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Matrix Manipulation (In-Place)

<br />

Implements an algorithm to rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees in-place, demonstrating efficient memory usage and spatial reasoning.
<br />




0x08-making_change&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dynamic Programming / Greedy Algorithms
<br />


Solves the "coin change" problem, calculating the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount, a common dynamic programming challenge.

<br />



0x09-island_perimeter&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Grid Traversal / Search Algorithms
<br />


Calculates the perimeter of an "island" (connected '1's) in a grid of '0's and '1's, demonstrating skills in grid traversal (similar to DFS/BFS).

<br />



0x0A-primegame&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Game Theory & Number Theory
<br />


Solves a game theory problem based on prime numbers, determining the winner of a game given a set of numbers and rules.
<br />
**üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Demonstrated**

The projects in this repository collectively showcase my proficiency in:

API Design & Optimization: Building, paginating, and consuming RESTful APIs.

Performance & Scaling: Using caching (Redis) and message queues to build fast, resilient systems.

Asynchronous Processing: Writing workers to handle background tasks.

Algorithmic Problem-Solving: Breaking down complex problems and implementing efficient solutions using data structures, dynamic programming, and backtracking.

Low-Level Data Manipulation: Understanding and working with data at the bit level (e.g., UTF-8 validation).

Software Globalization: Implementing i18n and localization.

DevOps & Tooling: Working with Redis, message brokers, and modern Python/JavaScript environments.

**üì¶ How to Explore**

Each directory is a standalone project. To run any of them:

1. **Clone this repository.**

Navigate into a specific project folder (e.g., cd 0x00-pagination).

Each project has its own set of dependencies. Please refer to the requirements.txt (for Python) or package.json (for JavaScript) within each folder.
